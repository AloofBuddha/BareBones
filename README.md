# BareBones

## Intro

**BareBones** is a prototype of a super-basic boilerplate for the GraceShopper project of Senior Phase. My goal is to create something that is complete in that it sets up all essential components, but is unopinionated, is open for further configuration, and is ideally simple to read and walkthrough.

## Project Values

1. Simplicity
2. Minimal-Complete Project Structure
3. Unopinionated
4. Explicitness before Cleverness
5. Prioritize Essentials before Whistles

## Walkthrough

This will be a basic overview of the steps I am taking. Try and not be too pedantic Ben!

1. Git Setup
  - [x] `git init`
  - [x] add README.md
  - [x] `git commit -m "first commit"`
  - [x] create remote Github repo
  - [x] `git remote add origin <my-remote-github-url>`
  - [x] `git push -u origin master`

2. NPM setup + dependencies

3. create express backend to serve a basic HTML page
