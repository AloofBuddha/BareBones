# BareBones

## Intro

**BareBones** is a prototype of a super-basic boilerplate for the GraceShopper project of Senior Phase. My goal is to create something that is complete in that it sets up all essential components, but is unopinionated, is open for further configuration, and is ideally simple to read and walkthrough.

## Project Values

1. Simplicity
2. Minimal-Complete Project Structure
3. Unopinionated
4. Explicitness before Cleverness
5. Prioritize Essentials before Whistles

## To Do

Towards that end, my first task is:

- setup git, push to remote
- include basic dependencies
- create express backend to serve a basic HTML page

## Walkthrough

This will be a basic overview of the steps I am taking. Try and not be too pedantic Ben!

1. git init, add README.md, create Github repo and push
